                            It is vigorous for the governments around the world to be on the “cloud”. Gartner predicts that security will replace cost saving and agility to be the main consideration for government departments to choose cloud computing services. It is the trend of the times for governments to be on the “cloud”, and for governments, it is imperative to build a comprehensive cloud service review system to ensure the security and controllability of government data.

With the increasingly complex modern government affairs, the intelligent level of traditional government is now unsuitable for the new trend.
